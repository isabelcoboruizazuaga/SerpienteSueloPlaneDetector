# SerpienteSueloPlaneDetector
Little test with Vuforia plane detector. The app detects floor and places a mobile snake on touch. The user can move the snake and change its size.

As it's a vuforia project i wasn't able to use github with it. Here you can find a .zip with the code and the apk.
You need a mobile phone with android and AR Core to play.
